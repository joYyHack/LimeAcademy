- [ ] Implement testing scenarios for the Book Library contract
- [ ] Run Solidity Coverage Report
- [ ] Try to hit 100% coverage for your Smart Contract (Ask your mentor for suggestions!)
- [ ] Create a deployment script and task for the contract.
- [ ] Add configuration for deployment on Goerli or Sepolia.
- [ ] Prepare a separate task for Goerli or Sepolia deployment
- [ ] Read any sensitive data (account private keys, API key and etc.) from .env file or from the CLI
- [ ] Note and save your deployed contract address.
- [ ] Create subtasks for printing valuable info after deployment
